### Development ###

To run convenient development server with hot reloading:

```
php artisan serve # Will serve backend on localhost:8000
yarn hot # Will serve frontend on loaclhost:8080 and proxy api requests to localhost:8000
```

And open http://localhost:8080

Alternatively you can use watch method:

```
yarn watch
```

And open http://localhost:8000

To compile assets for production run:
```
yarn prod

# Or to display bundle analyzer run:
yarn production -- --env.analyzer true 
```


### Development with Docker ###

If you want to use more features like Redis queues, MariaDB database,
sending and viewing sent emails you can use Docker setup on this project.

For you you will need Docker installed on your host [https://docs.docker.com/install/](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

To build the image for Docker, run:

    docker-compose build

It will build all images and run all needed containers.

Then use ENV variables, prepared specificly for Docker:

    cp .env.docker.example .env
    docker-compose run php php artisan key:generate

Migrate and seed database, and install Passport:

     docker-compose run php php artisan migrate --seed
     docker-compose run php php artisan passport:install

To run the project in Docker just run:

    docker-compose up

And open http://localhost:8000

To run all the Artisan or Test commands you can use `docker-compose run php` before the command to run it in the container.
If you want to run command in currently running container, use `docker-compose exec php`.


### Tests ###

To run all PHPUnit tests:

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit 
# Or
yarn test
```

To run Cypress E2E tests:

```
php artisan serve
yarn e2e-run
# Or you can open GUI with
yarn e2e
```


### Demo Credentials ###

For testing application the database is seeded with sample users:

* Administrator: email = admin@gmail.com, password = 123456
* Manager: email = manager@gmail.com, password = 123456
* User: email = user@gmail.com, password = 123456


### TODO ###

- Setup Travis to run Cypress tests
- Add more E2E cypress tests
